Create a C# program that does the following:
- Reads a single C# file and then there are 10 items to be checked, each of which will generate an appropriate printout depending on whether the requirements are met or not. If all requirements are met it should simply print "All requirements are met!"
1. The code in the file follows C# styling conventions
2. The visibility of subroutines and attributes must be defined (public, private). No public static variables
3. No useless classwide attributes. But if they are needed, const is used. All pictures, animations, videos, sounds are attributes using static readonly.
4. DRY is followed. No repetitive functions with very similar structure that can be combined in to one. If something simple can be done in a simple loop, it has to done that way.
5. There is at least one array or list
6. There is at least one loop
7. No useless literals when it would make sense to use variable instead
8. Every subroutine has 2 empty lines afterwards after the last }
9. Every class, attribute and subroutine/function has documentation
10. There is at least one function
